    "description": "Asfalt was my final project of my second year of studies. The brief was extremely vague, so it left us completely free in terms of conception and execution, the only demand was to create a typographic specimen in a physical format. At the time, I had taken a major inspiration in anti-design work. I was especially interested in super condensed and stretched fonts. While in my research I came across this typeface which blew me away the second I saw it.  This visual makes reference to the Vietnam war that was currently going on. Many of the soldiers of colour who fought had their homes torn down while they were away. It was exactly what I was looking for, and on top of that it was a variable typeface. This gave me even more creative liberty to play around with it. The typeface was originally drawn by Dinamo Type being based off of road markings. As I’m sure you’ve noticed, road markings when seen from a top down angle appear extremely stretched as they are meant to be viewed from the perspective of a driver. Conceptually I wanted to stay on this idea of the road, and so I created a 4 meter long leporello that talked about the history of racism and highways in the United States. The story all starts with the initial conception of the highway system at the 1939 New York World Fair. The construction of highways throughout cities almost always resulted in some sort of black or brown community being ran through or completely torn down. Throughout the specimen I cover some of the people who created this racist system that still affects POC’s today, as well as the people who fought to stop it. Each of my visuals present the typography while essentially ‘driving’ down this history of racism in the highway system. I use the word history very liberally here though, as later in the leporello I cover extremely recent events proving that this infrastructural segregation is still well and alive today. Visually I took reference from two main sources of inspiration. The first is the signage that one can often see while driving down the highway. The second was inspiration taken from the different protest signs and slogans that people had up during marches against these highways.",
