I merged multiple of his pre-existing music videos to form a base and then went off that to create the different typographic visuals.",

    "description": "Asfalt was my final project in my second year, created for a brief that gave us full freedom as long as it resulted in a physical typographic specimen. Inspired by anti-design and condensed, stretched fonts, I used a Dinamo Type face based on road markings to design a four-meter leporello about the history of racism and highways in the United States. Starting with the 1939 New York World’s Fair, it explores how highway construction destroyed black and brown neighborhoods. The visuals draw from highway signage and protest posters, turning typography into a reflection on ongoing infrastructural segregation.",

    "description": "A-OK was my vision for what a new Frank Ocean album could resemble. I deliberately based my visuals off the editorial work and the jewlery work he has done at HOMER rather than basing it off his older artistic direction. His older direction was far more tame than what he works with today which is far more experimental. Even looking just at the Blonde vinyl rerelase one can see that his art direction has had a big shift.",

    "description": "Hugo was an editorial project I worked on with three colleagues, where my main role was focused on the book’s editorial design. The brief required us to integrate AI in some way, and we chose to have it generate text rather than images. We invented a fictional person named Hugo, fed the AI fragments of information one might find online, and asked it to recreate his thoughts and life story. As the book progresses, the text shifts from surface-level facts to deeply personal details, questioning how well AI can know a person. Printed on transparent plastic, each page layers over the last, visually mirroring the accumulation of data. The typography evolves from clean sans serifs to chaotic, distorted scripts, symbolizing the unraveling of Hugo’s identity until the final reveal that everything about him was pieced together solely from public information.",
